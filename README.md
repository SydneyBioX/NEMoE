NEMoE is an R package implementing a nutrition-aware regularized mixture of experts model, which addresses diet cohort heterogeneity of gut microbiome in certain diseases. Additionally, the implementation can be viewed as a regularized mixture of experts model with an elastic penalty and a binary output. The input can be single-level or multi-level.
